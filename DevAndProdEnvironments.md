We should really be keeping keys separate. We don't want some file living on our computer that has ALL of our keys in it, like server/config/keys.js.

We should also separate dev and prod keys.

We should also have two separate DB's. One that is production, that we don't mess around with or manually deltee add stuff, etc. We can do that stuff in our separate, dev db.

Moving to the client side:
`sudo npm install -g create-react-app`
